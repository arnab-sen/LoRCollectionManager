# LoRCollectionManager
A collection manager for the digital card game Legends of Runeterra.

Uses the LoRDeckCodes library for deck code encoding/decoding (https://github.com/RiotGames/LoRDeckCodes).
Inspired by Hoarders of Runeterra by zofrex (http://hoarders-of-runeterra.zofrex.com/). Like HoR, the user must provide their collection code, e.g. by logging into Mobalytics (https://lor.mobalytics.gg/) and providing the JSON found at https://lor.mobalytics.gg/api/v2/riot/cards.
